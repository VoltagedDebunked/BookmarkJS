# Notes from developer
Hello, this is Voltaged. Just wanted to leave this part of the README as a message to all that use this, and i wanna say one thing: Thank you, even if you make money off of this, i just want you to do good things with the code, for education or work, its for anything, except for bad things i mentioned in #Use. Anyways, good luck with your project, hope this helps!
